We are using a Dockerfile:
# Use Python 3.9 base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Python application file into the container
COPY app.py .

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

then running a few commands in the terminal:

docker build -t my_python_app .

docker run --rm -e MY_ENV_VAR=World my_python_app

after these 2 the image is created in docker and the app is being run.


In my opinion this exercise was hard for me, but made me understand a lot of things 
about applications and docker. It made me think outside the box and do a lot of research
online being sure i give the good commands. I went through a little problem until
i found out how to install a text editor on cmd to make sure i create a Dockerfile 
with no extension.
