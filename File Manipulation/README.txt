I've had some knowledge of linux and file manipulation, but this exercise 
really made me search and find the best solution. The only hardship i found is 
having to learn again every syntax for the bash commands, but once you get used
to it, it becomes natural. I don't think there were impossible parts about 
this exercise, only the parts you have to look up online for extra information 
or help. As for the setup it is best to install a code editor first on your
new container, then establish a network connection for the network commands to 
work properly then enabling permissions for the script to be executable.
